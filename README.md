# Psychic-Game

This is a very simple guessing game.

1. The computer will generate a letter at random.
2. The user then has 9 tries to guess that letter.
3. The user's guesses will be displayed under the guesses so far section and no duplicate guesses will be tallied.
4. If the player guesses the letter correcly within the alloted number of attempts a win will be recorded and the game will     restart.
5. If the player is unable to guess the letter correctly a loss will be recorded and the game will restart.
